# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Anthony Malek
- **Dot Number**: malek.36
- **Due Date**: 2/4 @ 1:50 PM EST

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

## Pre-Assignment

> Before you jump in, we want you to take a moment to share your interests

> images in this section.

My personal hobbies include reading, writing, making music, and working on programming projects. On computer science particularly, I'm more interested in work dealing with data and algorithms than things like frontend web development, though I am interested in that too and am not very picky. In my career, I would love to eventually do work that deals heavily with math and the manipulation of information towards an endgoal. I find abstract math very interesting and engaging (I've really enjoyed my foundations course so far).
In general, I find I'm interested in the creation and analysis of systems in many forms. For example, even for something that seems a lot "freer" and unsystematic like writing, I think I enjoy how you have to pay a lot of attention to the way metaphorical imagery, rhythmic flows, and particular choices of syntax combine and contrast in very complex ways to create some overall impression. A popular school of thought for the analysis of texts was  structuralism, but since thinkers like Deleuze and Guattari have shared their conceptions of Schizoanalysis and desire flows, Manuel de Landa has reconceptualized history as a plane of nonlinear dynamics "A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History", Marx's materialist ideas of labor have been developed to apply to even more areas of philosophy, and engineering has just developed as a whole, I think even writing and philosophical texts have been starting to become understood as something less static as a structure and more like a system. I love philosophers who get ambitious and develope a whole new framework of metaphysical understanding, like Spinoza with his Ethics. It's a new system to analyze. I spoke against Structuralism, but in a bit glib of a way. I like structures and what it brings to things as well.

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: Logic Gate
  - **Description**:
    - This component models a logic gate and its interactions with other logic gates, with the possibility of connecting multiple gates.
      The intent of the design is to keep the kernel relatively contained to the simple
      individual behavior of one logic gate and its basic connection to other gates.
      The secondary methods would then contain more complex interactions and information
      about the state of the logic gate relative to the other gates it is connected to.
      The gates would use '1' and '0'.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
      'void disconnect()': Disconnects 'this' from its inputs
      'void connect(LogicGate n)': Connects 'this' to the output of 'n'
      'void connect(LogicGate n, LogicGate m)': Connects 'this' to the outputs of 'n' and 'm'
      'int value()': Returns the immediate output value of 'this'.
      'void changeGate(logicGate n)': Changes the gate type of 'this' to 'n'.
      'String gateType()': Returns the type of gate of 'this', ex: "AND"
      'logicGate[] connections()': Returns an array of the logicGates that feed into the input of 'this'.
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - 'int gateDepth()': Reports the depth of 'this' in its chain
      'int totalValue()': Reports the output boolean of the full chain 'this' is a member of.
      'void negateChain()': Turns the chain of logic gates into its negation

  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - This component would be mutable. All OSU components have to be mutable to inherit from Standard, and multiple methods, like "negateChain()" and "changeGate(logicGate n), change the value of the variable.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - The component might rely on an internal class to determine the way its logic
        gates operate, but I'm not sure.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - It might use a constant set to store valid constructors.

    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example
      -Yes, 'connections()' allows us to access other logic gates in the chain
       and 'value()' allows us to find the value of gates, meaning we could implement 'totalValue()'
       with our kernel methods. The gateDepth could be counted and remember internally
       by the logic gates, and connections could work forwards from the gates with
       the lowest gate depth to the highest. I do imagine a lot of this
       theoretical implementation would be changed if I went with trying to make this.

- Component Design #2: Music Playlist
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a musical playlist. This would
      store the minimum values corresponding to music to theoretically be accessed
      by another component and put to use in a working music player, or just work
      as a callable and functional lightweight queue of songs.

  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - 'void add(Map song)': adds 'song', a song name and corresponding relevant information, to 'this'
    - 'Map dequeue()': removes and returns the song at the front of the queue
    - 'Map front()': returns the song at the front of the queue of 'this'

  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - 'void add(Playlist n)': appends 'n' to 'this'.
    - 'void removeSong(String songName)': removes the map corresponding to key 'songName' from the queue of 'this'.
    - 'void shuffle()': randomly shuffles 'this'
    - 'String displayPlaylist()': returns a string of all the songs in 'this' and relevant information

  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, it would inherit from Standard, and methods like 'add' directly modify its value.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No, no internal classes would be necessary.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - No, I don't forsee why it would need any. No calculations are really done,
        and most of the methods just involve the moving of data structures.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, the kernel methods provide the necessary abilities necessary for the secondary methods.
      For example, 'removeSong()' could dequeue from 'this' and add it to a temp queue
      with 'add()' until it found the song it was trying to remove and just leave it out.

- Component Design #3: Shopping Cart
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a shopping cart and the way it holds
      different items. The shopping cart would hold an internal setThe kernel methods
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - 'void add(Map item)': Adds 'item' to 'this'. 'item' would store its cash value in an internal set of 'this', separate
    - from the list of actual items in the carts, and another set in 'this' would store the number of 'item' this in the cart.
    - 'NaturalNumber amount(String itemName)': Returns the number of an item the cart has
    - 'Map remove(String itemName)': Removes and returns one instance of map corresponding to 'itemName'
    - 'NaturalNumber cost(String itemName)': Returns the stored cost of an item
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - 'NaturalNumber total()': Returns the total cost the the items in the shopping cart
    - 'String itemsInCart()': Returns a string of an itemized list of the shopping cart items with relevant information
    - 'void add(Map item, NaturalNumber amount)': Adds the amount of 'amount' of 'item' to 'this'
    - 'Map remove(Map item, NaturalNumber amount)': Removes the amount of 'amount' of 'item' from 'this'
    - 'void add(String itemName, NaturalNumber amount)': Adds the amount of 'amount' of 'item' corresponding to 'itemName' to 'this'
    - 'Map remove(String itemName, NaturalNumber amount)': Removes the amount of 'amount' of 'item' corresponding to 'itemName' from 'this'
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, multiple methods access and modify its value. It also is an OSU component that inhereits from Standard.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - No, I don't forsee it needing any enums or constants.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, the kernel methods provide the necessary capabilities to implement the secondary methods.
        The basic functionality of adding and removig items from the shopping cart makes up the main functionality.
        For example, 'total()' could be implemented by getting the costs with 'cost(String itemName)' and amounts with
        'amount(String itemName)' and multiplying and adding them to return a total cost of all the
        items in the cart.

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 1 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 2 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 3 here --> component
```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
